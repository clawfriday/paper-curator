If the paper fits well into an existing category, use that exact category name.\n2. If it doesn't fit existing categories, suggest the most appropriate category from the primary list.\n3. If it's a very specific sub-topic and there are already many papers in a category, suggest a more specific sub-category.\n\nPaper Title: {title}\n\nPaper Abstract: {abstract}\n\nRespond with ONLY the category name, nothing else.
